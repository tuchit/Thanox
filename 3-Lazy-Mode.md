## Features
When some apps start or are active, they will also start some background services. These background services are likely to continue to run in the background even if you close the apps, which may cause some resource and battery consumption.

**Smart mode** is designed to actively stop these services when it **detects that the app is running in the background**.

`Tip: This mode is suitable for some apps that are not commonly used and do not rely on background services, which may cause the app to fail to work as expected. So try not to use it for social apps that highly rely on background services. `
